## Introduction

An API driven catalogue for all your security detections, rules and searches mapped back to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
This tool aims to provide your Security Operations and Engineering team(s) the ability to easily document, manage and audit detection coverage.

## Core Features

Most of these features are still in development and I welcome any input or collaboration.

- Manage detections via **CRUD** API
- Visualize detection coverage by mapping on **ATT&CK Navigator**
- Input **known attack types/paths** to determine coverage and identify visibility gaps
